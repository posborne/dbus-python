D-Bus Python Bindings 1.2.0 (2013-05-07)
========================================

The "compile like it's 1998" release.

Dependencies:

• libdbus 1.6 or later is now required.

Enhancements:

• Unicode Corrigendum 9: when used with a suitable version of libdbus
  (1.6.10 or later, or 1.7.2 or later), noncharacters in strings are
  now accepted

Fixes:

• Support DBusException('something with non—ASCII') under Python 2
  (Michael Vogt, smcv; fd.o #55899)

• Correct some misleading wording in COPYING which was written under the
  assumption that libdbus could actually be relicensed to MIT/X11
  (Thiago Macieira)

• Avoid variable-length arrays, because MSVC++ is still stuck in 1998
  (based on patches from Christoph Höger, fd.o #51725)

• Remove unnecessary uses of stdint.h (fd.o #51725)

• Add support for Unix compilers not supporting 'inline', for completeness

• Use GObject.__class__ instead of GObjectMeta, which can no longer be
  imported from gi.repository.GObject in pygobject 3.8

• Fix autoreconfiscation on Automake 1.13 (Marko Lindqvist, fd.o #59006)

D-Bus Python Bindings 1.1.1 (2012-06-25)
========================================

The "Lemonade Sky" release.

Dependencies:

• libdbus 1.6 or later is now recommended. It is not strictly required yet.

Fixes:

• Validate UTF-8 according to the rules libdbus uses, falling back to our
  own (inefficient) implementation if not compiled against dbus >= 1.6
  (fd.o #40817)

• Under Python 3, in the absence of introspection or signature='...',
  pass dbus.ObjectPath or dbus.Signature arguments with the obvious
  signature 'o' or 'g', not 's'. This previously only worked in Python 2.
  (fd.o #50740)

D-Bus Python Bindings 1.1.0 (2012-05-09)
========================================

The “eaten by spiders” release.

Deprecations:

• dbus.gobject_service is deprecated. Use dbus.gi_service and PyGI in new code.

API changes:

• dbus.gobject_service works in legacy PyGObject 2 applications again,
  like it did before 1.0. The down side is that it doesn't work in all PyGI
  applications any more, unlike 1.0. In PyGI applications, depend on
  dbus-python >= 1.1 and use dbus.gi_service instead - its API is the same.
  (fd.o #48904, Debian #670516)

• dbus.gobject_service has been removed from Python 3 builds altogether.

Enhancements:

• Use DBusBasicValue from libdbus 1.5, if available, rather than reinventing it

Fixes:

• Put sockets for the regression tests in /tmp, not the builddir, fixing
  test failures in a really long builddir (fd.o #46747)

• Fix a reference leak in dbus_py_variant_level_set (fd.o #47108)

• Modify AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS so the "another way" works with Python 3

D-Bus Python Bindings 1.0.0 (2012-01-24)
========================================

The "never trust a .0 release?" release.

Dependencies:

* libdbus 1.4 or later is now required.

* Python 2.6 or later is now required. If Python 3 is used, it must be
  version 3.2 or later.

* GNU make (or, at your own risk, another make with the GNU $(patsubst)
  extension) is now required.

API changes:

* dbus_bindings, which was never meant to be public API and has been
  deprecated for nearly 5 years, has finally been removed.

* The repr() of every dbus-python object is now unicode.

* The Python 3 API is not the same as the Python 2 API; see PY3PORT.rst
  for details.

• dbus.gobject_service uses PyGI, not PyGObject. (This was not meant to be
  an incompatible change, but unfortunately, it was. It was reverted in 1.1.0.)

Enhancements:

* Python 3 compatibility (fd.o #26420, Barry Warsaw)

* MethodCallMessage and SignalMessage now have a more useful repr()
  (Barry Warsaw)

Fixes:

* OOM while appending a unicode object to a message no longer leaks a string
  (Barry Warsaw)

* If libdbus somehow gives us invalid UTF-8, don't crash (Barry Warsaw)

* Fix rst2html failure in non-UTF-8 locales (Alexandre Rostovtsev)

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.84.0 (2011-05-25)
=========================================

The "Comrade Bill Bartram's Egalitarian Anti-Imperialist Soviet Stout" release.

Enhancements:

* fd.o #30812: add the UnixFd type, and support Unix fd passing if
  compiled against a new enough libdbus (Elvis Pfützenreuter)

* fd.o #34342: add Connection.set_allow_anonymous(bool) (Scott Tsai)

* fd.o #21017: add configure arguments PYTHON_INCLUDES and PYTHON_LIBS which
  can be used to override $PYTHON-config (Simon McVittie, based on a patch from
  Robert Schwebel)

Fixes:

* fd.o #35626: clear ProxyObject's pending introspection queue after
  execution (Scott Tsai)

* fd.o #22560: remove duplicate code from example-async-client (Simon McVittie)

* fd.o #36206: allow signature='x' among ProxyObject method arguments
  (Simon McVittie)

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.83.2 (2010-12-02)
=========================================

Dependencies:

* libdbus 1.2 is still supported, but libdbus >= 1.4 is recommended.

Fixes:

* Make BusConnection.list_activatable_names actually call ListActivatableNames,
  not ListNames (Johan Sandelin)

* Don't override CFLAGS when adding compiler warnings
  (Louis-Francis Ratté-Boulianne)

* Fix compilation on platforms where Py_ssize_t is larger than int, like x86-64
  (Elvis Pfützenreuter)

* fd.o #21831: deserialize empty byte arrays with byte_arrays=True as
  ByteArray(''), not ByteArray('None') (Simon McVittie)

* fd.o #23278, #25105: fix crashes when trying to append more struct entries
  than the signature allows with libdbus 1.4 (Simon McVittie)

* fd.o #23831: fix crashes when an embedded Python interpreter imports dbus,
  is finalized, is re-initialized, and re-imports dbus (Simon McVittie)

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.83.1 (2010-02-18)
=========================================

Fixes:

* fd.o #21172: avoid some deprecation warnings in Python 2.6

* fd.o #15013: add dbus.lowlevel.MESSAGE_TYPE_SIGNAL etc., for those who care
  about message types at a low level

* When removing signal matches, clean up internal state, avoiding a memory
  leak in long-lived Python processes that connect to signals from arbitrarily
  many object paths (fd.o #17551, thanks to Marco Pesenti Gritti)

* When setting the sender of a message, allow it to be org.freedesktop.DBus
  so you can implement a D-Bus daemon in pure Python (patch from Huang Peng)

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.83.0 (2008-07-23)
=========================================

Features:

* Add bindings for DBusServer (thanks to Mathias Hasselmann, Huang Peng;
  fd.o #14322, #15514).

* Omit the service's traceback from certain D-Bus errors: specifically, those
  that were probably deliberately raised as part of an API. Subclasses
  of DBusException that indicate programmer error can turn the traceback
  back on if it seems likely to be useful.

Fixes:

* Don't emit spurious Error messages if libdbus gives object-path handlers
  a message that isn't a method call (most likely because of binding to a
  locally emitted signal, as in fd.o #14199).

* Make multiple filters added by Connection.add_message_filter work
  (fd.o #15547, thanks to Huang Peng).

* Make the API docs build correctly when out-of-tree

* Require dbus 1.0 so we can get rid of DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.82.4 (2007-12-10)
=========================================

Fixes:

* supplying reply_handler but not error_handler raises
  MissingReplyHandlerException instead of MissingErrorHandlerException,
  and vice versa (fd.o #12304, patch from René Neumann)
* Using non-recursive make for dbus/ directory should fix builds in some
  environments (fd.o #12741)

Licensing:

* Everything is now under the same MIT/X11 license used for Collabora code in
  the previous release
* Added copyright headers to some files that were still missing them

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.82.3 (2007-09-27)
=========================================

Fixes:

* Out-of-tree builds with an absolute $(srcdir) can now build docs and run tests
* Closing private dbus.Bus no longer raises KeyError (fd.o #12096)
* async_err_cb(MyException()) now works (fd.o #12403)
* dbus.service.Object.remove_from_connection no longer claims that multiple
  exports aren't possible (fd.o #12432)
* Setting _dbus_error_name as a class attribute of DBusException subclasses
  works again

Deprecations:

* dbus.Bus(private=True) (use dbus.bus.BusConnection in new code, dbus.Bus
  basically just adds the shared-connection behaviour)

Licensing:

* Code for which Collabora is the only copyright holder is now under the
  same permissive MIT/X11 license under which dbus core is being relicensed
  (this allows everything the old license would have allowed, and more)

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.82.2 (2007-08-01)
=========================================

Incompatibility with 0.82.1:

* If you pass the timeout argument to call_async or an asynchronous proxy
  method call and expect it to be in milliseconds, you should change the
  argument to be in seconds, and require dbus-python >= 0.82.2.

  This feature didn't work at all in versions prior to 0.82.1, so any code
  that works with 0.82.0 or earlier is unaffected.

Features:

* @dbus.service.method supports a rel_path_keyword argument for the benefit
  of fallback objects, which provides the method implementation with the path
  of the object within the exported subtree. For instance, if you have a
  fallback object exported at /Fallback, and you call a method that has
  rel_path_keyword='rel_path' on /Fallback and on /Fallback/Some/Where, the
  method implementation will be called with rel_path='/' and with
  rel_path='/Some/Where' respectively. (fd.o #11623)

* If you have epydoc version 3 (currently in beta), API documention is now
  generated by default.

Fixes:

* As mentioned under "Incompatibilities" above, Connection.call_async()
  measures timeouts in seconds, as was always intended.
  This means that calls through a proxy object with a reply_handler and
  error_handler will measure the timeout in seconds too.

* Introspect() now works on objects exported in more than one location.
  (fd.o #11794)

* Building against Python 2.4 on non-Debian-derived distributions, or a
  non-default Python version on Gentoo, should work again (revenge
  of fd.o #11282, thanks Eyal Ben David).

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.82.1 (2007-07-11)
=========================================

The "double precision" release.

Fixes:

* Parse the timeout correctly in send_message_with_reply() and
  send_message_with_reply_and_block(), fixing the use of non-default timeouts
  (bugs.fd.o #11489)
* The tutorial no longer uses interactive-Python syntax, as it confused users.
  (bugs.fd.o #11209)
* When making a call via a proxy object with ignore_reply=True, also get the
  necessary introspection data asynchronously. This can avoid deadlocks in
  some cases, such as calling methods in the same process (though this is not
  recommended, for efficiency and sanity reasons).
* dbus.lowlevel exposes enough constants to write correct filter functions.
* We don't use dbus_watch_get_fd() (deprecated in libdbus) unless our libdbus
  is too old to have the modern replacement, dbus_watch_get_unix_fd().

Deprecations:

* Omitting the bus argument in the BusName constructor is deprecated.
  The fact that it uses the globally shared connection to the session bus by
  default is uncomfortably subtle.

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.82.0 (2007-06-19)
=========================================

Features:

* dbus.service.Object can start off with no Connection or object path, and
  become exported later. If suitable class attributes are set, objects can
  even be exported on multiple connections, or with multiple object-paths,
  or both.

* dbus.service.FallbackObject implements a whole subtree of object-path space
  (fd.o #9295).

* ``@method`` accepts a parameter ``connection_keyword`` so methods can find
  out which connection to use for any follow-up actions.

* ``@signal`` has a new parameter ``rel_path_keyword`` which gets the path at
  which to emit the signal, relative to the path of the FallbackObject.
  ``path_keyword`` is now deprecated, and will raise an exception if used
  on an object with ``SUPPORTS_MULTIPLE_OBJECT_PATHS``, including any
  ``FallbackObject``.

Fixes:

* In watch_name_owner, only the desired name is watched!

* When cleaning up signal matches, errors are ignored. This avoids using up
  scarce pending-call allowance on dbus-daemon < 1.1, and emitting error
  messages if we get disconnected.

* Signal handlers which are bound to a unique name are automatically
  disconnected when the unique name goes away, reducing the likelihood that
  applications will leak signal matches.

* Some corrections were made to the tutorial (@service and @method take a
  parameter dbus_interface, not just interface; fd.o #11209).

* ${PYTHON}-config is used to get the Python include path (patch from
  Sebastien Bacher/Ubuntu, fd.o #11282).

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.81.1 (4 June 2007)
==========================================

Features:

* When an Error message on the bus is represented as a DBusException, the
  error name is copied into the exception and can be retrieved by
  get_dbus_name(). Exception handlers should use this instead of looking at
  the stringified form of the exception, unless backwards compatibility
  is needed.
* DBusException objects now get all arguments from the Error message, not
  just the first (although there will usually only be one). Use the 'args'
  attribute if you need to retrieve them.
* The Connection, BusConnection and Bus classes have a method
  list_exported_child_objects(path: str) -> list of str, which wraps
  dbus_connection_list_registered()
* You can remove objects from D-Bus before they become unreferenced, by
  using dbus.service.Object.remove_from_connection()
  (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10457)

Bug fixes:

* Don't deadlock when removing a signal match that tracks name-owner changes.
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=426412)
* Include child nodes in introspection using list_exported_child_objects()

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.81.0 (9 May 2007)
=========================================

The 'series of tubes' release
-----------------------------

This is a feature release with support for non-bus-daemon connections
and improved GObject integration.

Features:

* Bus has a superclass dbus.bus.BusConnection (a connection to a bus daemon,
  but without the shared-connection semantics or any deprecated API)
  for the benefit of those wanting to subclass bus daemon connections

* BusConnection has a superclass dbus.connection.Connection (a
  connection without a bus daemon) for use in peer-to-peer situations,
  or distributed pseudo-bus situations without a bus daemon such as
  Telepathy's Tubes API

* dbus.gobject_service.ExportedGObject is like dbus.service.Object, but
  is also a subclass of GObject (with the necessary metaclass magic to
  make this work). Until someone has verified that the GObject side of
  things works as expected too, I consider this API to be potentially
  subject to change!

* Connection and BusConnection have gained a number of useful methods,
  including watch_name_owner (track name owner changes asynchronously,
  avoiding race conditions), call_blocking and call_async (blocking and
  asynchronous method calls without going via a proxy - note that these
  are semi-low-level interfaces which don't do introspection), and
  list_names, list_activatable_names and get_name_owner which are
  simple wrappers for the corresponding org.freedesktop.DBus methods

* dbus.Interface (now also available at dbus.proxies.Interface)
  and dbus.proxies.ProxyObject now have some reasonably obvious properties.

Deprecations:

* All keyword arguments called named_service are deprecated in favour of an
  argument called bus_name (to be compatible with both older and newer
  dbus-python, you should pass these positional arguments).

* The bus keyword argument to dbus.proxies.ProxyObject is deprecated in
  favour of an argument called conn, because proxies will work on non-bus
  connections now (again, for maximum compatibility you should use a
  positional argument for this).

* No warning is raised for this, but I consider calling any remote method
  on a ProxyObject or Interface whose name is either alllowercase or
  lower_case_with_underscores to be deprecated, and reserve the right
  to add properties or methods of this form in future releases - use
  ProxyObject.get_dbus_method if you must call a remote method named in
  this way. Methods named following TheUsualDBusConvention or
  theJavaConvention are safe.

Bugfixes:

* Exceptions in signal handlers print a stack trace to stderr (this can
  be redirected elsewhere with Python's logging framework). Partially
  addresses fd.o #9980.

* The reserved local interface and object path are properly checked for.

* When you return a tuple that is not a Struct from a method with no
  out_signature, it's interpreted as multiple return values, not a
  single Struct (closes fd.o #10174).

* If send_with_reply() returns TRUE but with pending call NULL, dbus-python
  no longer crashes. This can happen when unexpectedly disconnected.

* Arguments are not examined for functions declared METH_NOARGS (this is
  unnecessary and can cause a crash).

Other notable changes:

* dbus-python uses the standard Python logging framework throughout.
  The first time a WARNING or ERROR is generated, it will configure the
  logging framework to output to stderr, unless you have already
  configured logging in your application.

* The tutorial now advocates the use of add_signal_receiver if all you
  want to do is listen for signals: this avoids undesired activation,
  e.g. of Listen or Rhythmbox (!). Addresses fd.o #10743, fd.o #10568.
